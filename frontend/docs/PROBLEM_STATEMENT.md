Problem Statement 4
AI Agent Evaluation and Reliability Engine
Theme: Agent Infrastructure, Testing and Failure Prediction
Problem Context
Autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed for consequential work, yet industry
benchmarks report failure on the majority of real-world tasks attempted, with cited rates
near 70%. Teams typically ship agents against a handful of manually written test prompts,
so real failure modes - tool-call loops, hallucinated confidence, unsafe destructive actions,
silent goal drift - surface only after deployment on live data.
Challenge Statement
Build an AI-powered platform that automatically generates realistic and adversarial test
scenarios for a given agent, runs it in a sandboxed environment, scores failure modes, and
produces a reliability report, functioning as continuous integration for autonomous agents.
Illustrative Directions
• Scenario Generation Engine - reads an agent's tools, prompt and task domain to generate
realistic and adversarial test scenarios at scale.
• Sandboxed Execution and Replay Harness - runs the agent against generated scenarios
with mocked tools, capturing traces for deterministic replay.
• Failure Mode Classifier - categorises why a run failed, turning raw pass or fail results into
an actionable taxonomy.
• Destructive Action Guardrail Tester - probes an agent's willingness to perform irreversible
actions under pressure or ambiguous instruction.
• Reliability Scorecard and Regression Tracker - scores and tracks agent reliability across
versions and task categories
